# Keyboard Editor GUI for M2K4L

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The repo requires Godot and Dotnet to build. Why? Couldnt find a good GUI designer in all my five minutes of researching lol. And no, this package or whatever you call this isnt required to run M2K4L. A fallback can be used in place of this.

>[!NOTE]
>Pardon the horrible code than usual, I dont really use godot or C# or that often. Filenames? Yeah thats on me.
